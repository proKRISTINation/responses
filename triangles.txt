Proof: 

Assuming the length of the stick is 'S' and that the 2 breaking points are called 'a' and 'b'. The pieces will form a triangle if the length of each individual piece is less than the sum of the length of the other 2 pieces. 0 < a < b < S and that a < S/2 and b > S/2. Thus, b < a + S/2. The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Therefore, ((S/2) * (S/2))/(S*S) = 1/4.

Program:

S = Length of stick 
a = breaking point 1
b = breaking point 2
x = 0 /* variable to count successful number of triangles */
t = 0 /* variable to count trials */

while t < 10,000
	/* Determine the breaking points"
	a = random number between 0 and S 
	b = random number between 0 and S
	a != b and a < b
	
	/*determine length of size*/
	side1  = a
	side2 = (b - a)
		side3 = S - side2 or S - side1
	side1 < S/2 and side2 > S/2 

	if side3 < (side1 +side2)
		x = x+1
	t = t + 1
print x /t
